Project Roadmap:
Choose best audio descriptors for implementation                                                [ ]
Create a few basic descriptors to test matching on                                              [x]
Create database object matching algorithm                                                       [ ]
- Starting with a brute force algorithm that tests every entry against every other entry        [ ]
Create simple synthesis algorithm                                                               [ ]
Create all descriptors required for project                                                     [ ]
Work on improving matching and synthesis algorithms                                             [ ]
Create front-end?                                                                               [ ]
