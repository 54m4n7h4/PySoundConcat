Welcome to Concatenator's documentation!
========================================

A python script for generating granular synthesis driven representations of
audio files based on audio database analysis.

    :align: center

This script was developed to explore the creative potential of combining
short-time audio analyses with granular synthesis, to synthesize perceptually
related representations of target audio files. Through use of analysed
databases of varying sizes, an output can be generated that represents a mix of
the spectral and temporal features of the original target sound and the corpus
of source sounds from the database.
