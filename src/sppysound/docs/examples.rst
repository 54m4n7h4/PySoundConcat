API Usage Examples
==================

WARNING: As examples use the same files, only one notebook can be run at a
time. Make sure one notebook has been closed and halted before starting the
next.

This section contains three examples of how to use the API for creating and
comparing audio databases. Examples have been created using Jupyter interactive
notebooks that can be found in the project folder and used to step through the
code line by line interactively to see results.
