Overview
========
Concatenator is a tool for synthesizing interpretations of a sound, through the
analysis and synthesis of audio grains from a database of sounds.
The program works by analysing overlapping segments of audio (known as grains)
from both the target sound and the source database, then searching for the
closest matching grain in the source database to the target sound. Finally, the
output is generated by overlap-adding the best matches.
